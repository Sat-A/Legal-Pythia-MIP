account on gender equality as required by Norwegian
law. The results are demonstrated in the table below.
We note that the analysis of bonus and overtime was
carried out for the first time in 2023, and numbers for
these indicators are therefore not comparable with or
reported for in earlier years.

At KPMG AS there are no noticeable disparities
in base wage between men and women in FY23.
Gender disparities become more pronounced
when considering overtime and bonuses. Men
work more overtime than women at the Associate
and Senior Associate levels, resulting in higher
overtime payouts. With regards to bonuses for
Managers and Directors, women are on average
rewarded with a lower bonus than men.

the foundation of a resilient culture ready to meet

our work and the example we set — as we inspire
confidence and empower change throughout the world.
